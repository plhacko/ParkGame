# Park Game

## About
Mobile multiplayer RTS game where the player becomes a commander on a battlefield. The twist is that the battlefield is mapped on a real park and the player's position is determined by GPS (the game will be in some sense an augmented reality game). Players then will be divided into teams in which the players will share units and structures. Teams will then use those units to battle for dominance in a few gamemodes (currently 1). There will be for simplicity only a few units and structures, the focus of the game should be on the novelty of GPS controls and cooperation within the team.

This game was created between 2023 and 2024 as a part of the software project course at the faculty of mathematics and physics at Charles University.

The game was created by:
- Hong Son Ngo
- Alžběta Mrkvová
- Tomáš Plhák
- Filip Ruta
- Ondřej Vaic

Many thanks to the project lead RNDr. Tomáš Holan, Ph.D., and also many thanks to Vojtěch Pinc, the author of the sprite animations.
